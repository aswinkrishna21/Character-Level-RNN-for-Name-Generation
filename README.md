# Character-Level-RNN-for-Name-Generation

The following repository contains a text file with over 60000 Indian Names.
This was my first ever character level RNN and I decided to build my own model to generate some Indian names. Attached is the ipynb file for the same where I have trained the model using Multi-layered LSTM's and generated some pretty unique(?) Indian names.
Further fine tuning can definitely be done on this.
